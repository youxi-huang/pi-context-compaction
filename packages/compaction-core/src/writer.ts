// `quotableOriginals`, candidate reading with envelope removal, the diagnostics-and-repair sequencing
// (parse, envelope removal, schema, scope, quotation, budget, continuation; one repair per compaction),
// `sumMemoryUsage`, `writerContractHashes`, and the progress and outcome records the writer reports.
// The transport is the caller's to supply: model resolution, the reasoning-effort mapping, the host's
// own request built from each contract request (where the session ID travels as the provider's cache
// key), dispatch, the prefix estimate and the usage summary stay with the adapter, because cache reuse
// depends on reproducing the host's own request. The Pi adapter binds them in preview/writer.ts. The
// host's `SessionEntry`, `Usage`, `AssistantMessage` and `ThinkingLevel` types became the structural
// record, usage and response shapes below. Requests, rules bytes, thrown messages and repair
// accounting are unchanged (rule K2).
